# Ghoststrap 

A simple barebones theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

To download, visit the [releases](https://github.com/jeffm13/Ghoststrap/releases) page.

## About the theme
I've been impressed with [Quartz](http://www.qz.com) since its launch. The Quartz team has managed to combine usability and readability, keeping things as simple as possible. No clutter, no fluff.  The look and feel of Ghoststrap is inspired by quartz. In keeping with the theory behind Ghost, Ghoststrap has several goals:

- Clean, responsive design
- Take advantage of Bootstrap to manage responsive behavior
- Jazz things up a little with some animations
- Text content takes precedence over images, but both are visible and readable. 

## Features
- A transparent navigation bar fixes itself to the top when scrolling
- Blog and portfolio views that rely on tags. 
- Related posts that list all posts with similar tags
- Customizable Disqus comments
- Customizable Google analytics
- Font-awesome icons
- Intelligent header images: the blog image is used for index pages, post images used on post pages.
